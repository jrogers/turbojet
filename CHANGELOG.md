# Changelog

Notable changes to the published crates.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-29)

The first release.

### `turbojet`

- FIX session layer for FIX 4.2 and later, and FIXT.1.1 with FIX 5.0 SP2: logon (credentials,
  NextExpectedMsgSeqNum), sequencing, gap detection with messages ahead of a gap kept until it's
  filled, resends and gap fills, heartbeats and TestRequests, logout, and a counterparty's sequence
  reset while logged on.
- FIXT.1.1: DefaultApplVerID negotiated at logon, per-message ApplVerID in either direction,
  CstmApplVerID and ApplExtID passed through, and messages resent in the version they were sent in.
- At-least-once delivery to the application: a message counts as received only once it's handled,
  and the one in flight at a crash is marked as possibly handled when it's resent.
- Checks from the FIX session test cases: SendingTime accuracy, OrigSendingTime on resends, header
  field order, required header fields, and optional validation against a data dictionary (feature
  `validation`). Routing fields kept in the header, and rejects routed back.
- `Acceptor` and `Initiator` over TCP, TLS with optional mutual authentication (feature `tls`),
  initiator failover, and graceful shutdown.
- Memory and disk session storage, session schedules (named time zones with feature `tz`), and
  operator control of sequence numbers.
- Typed messages, groups and enums through the `fix_message!`, `fix_group!` and `fix_enum!` macros,
  with strict parsing on request (`Message::parse_strict`).
- Structured logging, and Prometheus-compatible metrics (feature `metrics`).

### `turbojet-dictionary`

- Loads FIX Orchestra and QuickFIX-format data dictionaries, and merges a venue's QuickFIX-format
  additions onto either.

### `turbojet-codegen`

- Generates `fix_enum!`, `fix_group!` and `fix_message!` invocations from a dictionary, from an
  application's `build.rs` or as a command.

### `turbojet-fix42`, `turbojet-fix43`, `turbojet-fix44`, `turbojet-fix50sp2`

- Every application message, group and enum of FIX 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 5.0 SP2, generated from the
  FIX Trading Community's official data.
