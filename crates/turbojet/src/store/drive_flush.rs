//! Making a commit's writes durable, one drive flush shared by the commits waiting at once.
//!
//! On macOS `fsync` only hands a file's writes to the drive, which may hold them in its cache
//! through a power loss; `F_FULLFSYNC` (std's `sync_data`) also flushes that cache, the whole
//! drive's, and costs milliseconds, and concurrent ones barely overlap. So a commit there
//! `fsync`s its own file, then waits for a full flush that started after its `fsync` returned:
//! one flushes the drive for every commit waiting, whichever file it's issued on. Elsewhere
//! `fdatasync` is per file and the journal merges concurrent ones, so a commit just syncs.
